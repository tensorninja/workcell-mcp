; grammar repository (MIT). Re-verified against the grammar version vendored here;

; Kept verbatim except: (1) the @reference.implementation patterns are dropped (impl blocks are
; not calls; they'd inflate edges without modeling call flow — calls drive edges, not declarations);
; (2) H4 W3 adds the two `::`-path / turbofish call patterns below (upstream has neither, so
; upstream loses the dominant Rust call form too); (3) H4 W3 moves the @definition.method capture
; from the `declaration_list` wrapper onto the `function_item` — see the note at that pattern.

; H4 W3 SPAN FIX (divergence from the vendored upstream file — see header). The `@definition.method`
; capture used to sit on the `declaration_list` WRAPPER. That node has no `body:` field, so ingest's
; span-widening walk climbed one more level to the `impl_item`/`mod_item` (which does) and every method
; in a block got THE WHOLE BLOCK as its [startByte,endByte) span. Consequences, all measured before the
; fix: `--expand=bump` printed the entire `impl Widget { ... }`; per-method loc/cx/ccx/params/maxNest
; described the block, not the method; and — the one that breaks the call graph — reference
; enclosing-attribution resolved EVERY call in the block to whichever method the DefSweep's active stack
; happened to leave on top (the last-sorted identical span), so `Self::helper()` inside `bump` was
; attributed to `helper` calling ITSELF. The discriminator this pattern exists for is "the function_item
; sits inside a declaration_list" — that is expressed by the pattern SHAPE, so the capture belongs on the
; function_item, where `body:` is found immediately and no climb happens. Dedup is unaffected: identity is
; (fileId, name-token start byte) and Method still outranks Function on specificity.

; Qualified `::`-path calls — the DOMINANT Rust call form
; (`Widget::new()`, `util::deep::deepfn()`, `Self::helper()`, `Widget::bump(&mut w)`), 100% invisible
; before this pattern. tree-sitter-rust nests scoped_identifier LEFT — `util::deep::deepfn` is
; `scoped_identifier(path: scoped_identifier(path: identifier, name: identifier), name: identifier)` —
; so the `name:` field IS the final segment at EVERY depth and ONE pattern covers all of them. The
; turbofish-on-a-TYPE spelling `Vec::<u32>::new()` is also this node kind
; (`scoped_identifier(path: generic_type, name: identifier)`, verified by --match), so it needs no

; `Vec::<u32>::new` parses as scoped_identifier-over-generic_type, covered above), so this one nesting
; is the whole form. No cast trap here — Rust has no `static_cast<T>(x)` call-shaped keyword.
