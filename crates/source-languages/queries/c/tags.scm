; Seeded from ripwire (Apache-2.0), which derived it from the upstream tree-sitter
; grammar repository (MIT). Re-verified against the grammar version vendored here;
; capture names are normalized to the Workcell vocabulary in src/roles.rs.
; ripwire C tags — written for ripwire (.c). Derived from the upstream tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c
; v0.24.1 queries/tags.scm (definitions only: struct/union/enum/typedef/function) plus the SAME
; @reference.call augmentation the C++ tags.scm already carries (upstream C tags ship definitions
; ONLY, matching upstream C++). tree-sitter-c is the grammar tree-sitter-cpp itself EXTENDS, so the
; lower node shapes below (function_declarator, field_expression, call_expression) are byte-for-byte
; the same as the C++ patterns in queries/cpp/tags.scm — this file mirrors them, C-only surface.
;
; C structure the call graph cares about:
;   - struct/union/enum/typedef -> def nodes (the containers + the type-alias bucket)
;   - function DEFINITIONS (function_declarator inside a function_definition, or a bare prototype
;     declaration) -> the def nodes calls resolve TO
;   - object-like (#define X 1) and function-like (#define F(x) ...) macros -> def nodes, same
;     @definition.macro bucket Rust's macro_definition already uses (macro-edges round: ingest.cpp's
;     defKind maps "macro" -> SymKind::Macro, t="macro" — the kind now says what the thing is; a
;     call-shaped invocation of a function-like macro's name is a role="macro" edge, never role="call",
;     and its replacement text is body-scanned for outgoing calls. Empty-body FUNCTION-LIKE macros are
;     dropped in ingest.cpp — an empty replacement defines nothing callable; object-like stay indexed)
;   - calls (bare `f()` and `recv->f()` / `recv.f()` via a struct field) -> the call references (edges)
;   - `#include` is captured separately by ingest.cpp::captureIncludes (NOT here — matches every
;     other C-family language; resolve.h's `.c`/`.h` IncludeLang::CFamily entry already existed).
;
; Deliberately NOT captured (noise, matching the C++/Java/Ruby convention): plain variables, struct
; fields, enumerators. NOT modeled: function POINTERS assigned dynamically (`ops->init = my_init;`
; then `ops->init()`) — the field_expression call pattern below fires on the CALL site syntax, not
; on data-flow, so it captures `s.fn()`/`s->fn()` call shapes the same way C++ member calls are
; captured; resolving WHICH function a pointer field holds is out of this tool's static-syntax scope
; (same limitation the C++ tags.scm documents for operator-overload calls).
