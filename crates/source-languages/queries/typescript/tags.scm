; capture names are normalized to the Workcell vocabulary in src/roles.rs.
; ripwire TypeScript tags — written for ripwire.
; The upstream tree-sitter-typescript tags.scm targets .d.ts declaration files
; (function_signature / method_signature) and ships no @reference.call, so it extracts
; almost nothing from ordinary .ts/.tsx source. This set covers real source: concrete
; declarations + arrow-function-bound consts + call/new references. Used for BOTH
; typescript and tsx (the tsx grammar is a superset).

(method_definition
  name: (property_identifier) @name) @definition.method

; `#render() {..}` — an ES #private method is a distinct node the pattern above never matched
; (same gap jsshapecheck closed for JS: the two tags.scm files are separate). 120 sites in
; openclaw @7a0a4c5f, 2026-08-04, with 326 `this.#x(...)` call sites — a class's whole internal
; call graph went missing.
(method_definition
  name: (private_property_identifier) @name) @definition.method

; `abstract foo(): T;` — the contract half of an abstract base. method_signature above only covers
; .d.ts-style signatures; an abstract member is its own node, so before this pattern an abstract
; class published its name and nothing a caller could bind to. 76 sites in openclaw — and --lego
; reads exactly this shape when it lists an interface's method contract beside its implementors.
(abstract_method_signature
  name: (property_identifier) @name) @definition.method

; `send = async (payload) => {..}` — a class field bound to a callable IS the class's callable
; surface: reachable as `obj.send(...)` exactly like a method_definition, and the whole point of the
; bound-method idiom. 287 sites in openclaw. Scoped to arrow/function VALUES on purpose: a
; public_field_definition with any value at all is >5000 sites there (a --match floor), i.e. mostly
; data members, and taking those would bury the map. Same reason the object-literal `pair` form
; stays out — see test/tsshapefix/objectliteral.ts.

; the lazy-facade export: `export const f: M["f"] = ((...args) => ..) as M["f"];`. The cast puts an
; as_expression (or satisfies_expression) where the pattern above looks for the arrow itself, so
; every one of these read as an unnamed const and — not being SCREAMING_SNAKE — was dropped by the
; convention gate. 105 sites in openclaw, and they are not marginal: that idiom is how its entire
; public `src/plugin-sdk/` surface is written, so each miss was an exported API entry point --for
; structurally could not surface.

; ---- module-level settings constants (r3 q10 — bench/headtohead/r3-headroom-2026-08-03) ----
; `const PASSWORD_HASHERS = [...]` at module scope: a settings/config constant is a real, rankable
; symbol — before these patterns a whole settings module contributed ZERO symbols to the map, so
; --for structurally could not surface it (the r3 head-to-head's only unrecoverable loss).
; Shape verified with --match: the (program …) wrapper keeps function-local consts out; the export
; form nests (program (export_statement (lexical_declaration …))) so it needs its own pattern.
; "const"-keyword-anchored (a top-level `let` is a mutable counter, not config). Scoped to
; SCREAMING_SNAKE names in ingest.cpp (constCaptureNeedsScreamingGate — tags predicates never run),
; so `const retryBudget = 3` stays unindexed and an ALL-CAPS arrow const dedups to its Function def.

(new_expression

; H4: qualified `new` — `new ns.Inner()` / `new a.b.C()`. member_expression nests LEFT (property: is
; always the final segment at any depth), so this binds the constructed CLASS name regardless of
; namespace depth — same ctor-ref-to-class-def precedent as the bare form above. Verified with
; --match on fixtures/ts at 2 AND 3 segments, empirically, not just assumed from the grammar shape.
