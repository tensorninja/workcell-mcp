; Seeded from ripwire (Apache-2.0), which derived it from the upstream tree-sitter
; grammar repository (MIT). Re-verified against the grammar version vendored here;
; capture names are normalized to the Workcell vocabulary in src/roles.rs.
; ripwire Java tags — written for ripwire (.java). Derived from the upstream
; tree-sitter-java v0.23.5 grammar node-types, verified against an AST dump (see the
; javarubycheck fixture). Java is a big grammar; we capture the OOP structure the call
; graph cares about and deliberately skip field/local noise.
;
; Java structure the call graph cares about:
;   - type declarations:  class / interface / enum → def nodes (the containers)
;   - method + constructor declarations → the def nodes calls resolve TO
;   - method invocations + object creations → the call references (edges)
;   - imports → reference edges to the imported name's final segment
;
; Deliberately NOT captured (noise): fields, local variables, annotations, `@name` on
; every type mention. Only defs + calls + imports become graph nodes/edges — matching
; every other language here. ONE exception (r3 q10): SCREAMING_SNAKE constant fields —
; see the settings-constant pattern below.

; ---- definitions ----

(class_declaration
  name: (identifier) @name) @definition.class

(interface_declaration
  name: (identifier) @name) @definition.interface

(enum_declaration
  name: (identifier) @name) @definition.type

(method_declaration
  name: (identifier) @name) @definition.method

; `Foo( .. ) { .. }` — a constructor; name is the type identifier
(constructor_declaration
  name: (identifier) @name) @definition.method

; settings constants (r3 q10 — bench/headtohead/r3-headroom-2026-08-03): `static final int
; MAX_POOL_SIZE = 32;` — the config-constant idiom. The pattern captures every field declarator
; (the grammar exposes no cheap static+final discriminant), and the SCREAMING_SNAKE gate in
; ingest.cpp (constCaptureNeedsScreamingGate) keeps the field-noise exclusion above intact:
; camelCase instance fields stay unindexed. Shape verified with --match on the constcheck fixture.
(field_declaration
  declarator: (variable_declarator
    name: (identifier) @name)) @definition.constant

; ---- references (calls + imports) ----

; foo( .. )  and  obj.foo( .. )  — both are method_invocation with a (identifier) name field
(method_invocation
  name: (identifier) @name) @reference.call

; new Foo( .. ) — object creation resolves to the constructor / class name
(object_creation_expression
  type: (type_identifier) @name) @reference.call

; H4: qualified `new` — `new Outer.Inner()` / `new a.Outer.Inner()`. scoped_type_identifier is FLAT
; at 2 segments (both type_identifier children direct) but RIGHT-recursive at 3+ (the outer node's
; own direct type_identifier child is always just the final one, the rest nest inside a child
; scoped_type_identifier `scope:`) — either way the trailing anchor `.` binds only the LAST
; type_identifier child of the OUTER node, which is always the constructed class name. Verified with
; --match at 2 and 3 segments; anchor semantics confirmed empirically, not just assumed from the
; grammar shape.
(object_creation_expression
  type: (scoped_type_identifier
    (type_identifier) @name .)) @reference.call

; import a.b.C;  — the last scoped-identifier segment is the imported name
(import_declaration
  (scoped_identifier
    name: (identifier) @name)) @reference.call
