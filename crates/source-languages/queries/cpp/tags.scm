; ---- out-of-line definitions at 2+ qualifier segments (ripwire addition — C1, memgraph F1) ----
; The upstream pattern above is the DEFINITION twin of the 2-segment CALL pattern the §H4 round replaced,
; and it fails for the same reason: tree-sitter-cpp nests qualified_identifier RIGHT-recursively, so
; `void nsD::OuterD::InnerD::deep3()` is qualified_identifier(scope: nsD, name: qualified_identifier(
; scope: OuterD, name: qualified_identifier(scope: InnerD, name: deep3))) and `name: (identifier)` binds
; nothing past the second `::`. The def was dropped at EXTRACTION — no `--skipped` row, no floor, no
; `unresolved=` — so every caller of such a method read as a leaf and the symbol was unreachable from every
; verb. Measured on memgraph (whose house style is exactly this shape): 575 of 4526 qualified out-of-line
; defs invisible, 16 of 29 extracted in one 35 KB file. ripwire's own src/ has ZERO instances, which is
; precisely why the definition half survived the round that fixed the reference half.
;
; WHY A SECOND PATTERN RATHER THAN WIDENING THE FIRST TO `name: (_)`. The reference side widened in place
; because its 2-segment pattern would otherwise DOUBLE-MINT (ingest.cpp performs no ref-level dedup). Here
; the two patterns are disjoint by construction: `declarator:` anchors both to the function_declarator, and
; the inner qualified_identifier this pattern binds is the OUTER one's `name:` child, never a declarator —
; so a given definition matches exactly one of them at every depth. Keeping them separate leaves every
; pre-fix capture byte-identical and keeps the depth-1 operator pattern below unambiguous. Widening to
; `(_)` would additionally sweep in `destructor_name` and `template_function` declarators, which are a
; different (still open, still disclosed) gap and not this one.
;
; The captured node is the INNER qualified_identifier — ingest.cpp descends it to the innermost `name:`
; link (innermostQualifiedName), which restores all three properties the depth-1 path already has: the
; bare final name, a `nameByte` on the identifier itself, and a PARENT whose `scope:` field is the
; IMMEDIATE enclosing type — so `deep3` keys as `InnerD::deep3`, not as the outermost `nsD::deep3`.

; ---- operator methods (ripwire addition) ----
; The upstream C++ tags capture methods only via identifier/field_identifier/qualified_identifier
; declarators; an OPERATOR's declarator is a distinct node kind (operator_name for symbolic/subscript/
; call/arrow ops, operator_cast for conversion ops), so operators were invisible. These three patterns
; mirror the method patterns above for each operator declarator kind. The @name span is the whole
; operator token — `operator==`, `operator[]`, `operator<<` (the last emitted XML-escaped as
; `operator&lt;&lt;`). LIMITATION: operator CALL edges are out of scope. Implicit `a == b` parses as a
; binary_expression (not a call_expression); resolving it to operator== needs semantic overload
; resolution, outside the tool's contract. Even EXPLICIT `a.operator==(b)` does not parse as a clean
; `field_expression field:(operator_name)` call in this grammar (its function child resolves to `a`),
; so no @reference.call pattern is added for it. Operators are captured as DEFINITIONS only; their
; fan-in stays low.

; ---- out-of-line NESTED CLASS/STRUCT definitions (ripwire addition — N08/N11/N12 candidate-head-bound
; and ugrep-extraction-gap lane, 2026-08-25) ----
; The two patterns above bind `name: (type_identifier)`, which matches only a BARE (unqualified) class
; name. A nested class DEFINED OUT OF LINE — the class-level twin of the out-of-line METHOD idiom the
; qualified_identifier method pattern above already handles — writes its own name as a qualified_identifier
; instead (`class Outer::Inner : Base { … };`), so neither upstream pattern matches and the class itself is
; silently dropped at EXTRACTION: no symbol, no --skipped row, no floor, invisible to `--for`/ranking/the
; call graph. Measured on ugrep's reflex/input.h: `class BufferedInput::dos_streambuf : public
; std::streambuf { … }` (and its sibling `class Input::dos_streambuf : … { … }`) never became a `cls`
; symbol, so a bare `--for="dos_streambuf"` could rank the CONSTRUCTOR (a real `fn` def, since a
; constructor's own name is the class name too) and the unrelated IN-CLASS forward declaration
; (`class dos_streambuf;`, captured by the plain pattern above with no qualifier at all — and, being
; unqualified, colliding across every enclosing class that forward-declares the same nested name) but never
; the gold definition itself.
;
; Members already scope correctly to "Outer::Inner" without this pattern — ingest.cpp's `enclosingScopeOf`
; walk is structural (it reads the class_specifier's own `name:` field AS WRITTEN, whether or not the tags
; query captured that node as a symbol), so a constructor inside the class body was never the problem. Only
; the CLASS's own bare name resolved to nothing, because nothing ever minted it as a symbol.
;
; Same fix, same shape as the out-of-line method pattern above: capture the qualified_identifier itself as
; @name. ingest.cpp's `cppDefNameReseat` (language-generic over every C++ definition capture, not method-
; specific) descends it to the innermost identifier for the symbol's bare NAME ("dos_streambuf"), and the
; canonical-scope rule two calls later (`qualifierOf` first, `enclosingScopeOf` only when that is empty)
; reads the immediate qualifier off the untouched parent for the SCOPE ("BufferedInput") — the same
; "out-of-line `A::b` -> 'A'" convention already in force for methods, so the class's own scope names its
; ENCLOSING container while its members' scope (unchanged) names the class itself, exactly as a normal
; (non-qualified) class/member pair already does. `body:(_)` on both patterns mirrors the upstream
; struct_specifier requirement above: only a real out-of-line DEFINITION carries a body — ISO C++ has no
; syntax for a qualified out-of-line FORWARD declaration of a nested class (`class Outer::Inner;` outside
; the class body is unqualified-only), so the bodyless case is not a live shape this drops on purpose.

; ---- module-level settings constants (ripwire addition — r3 q10) ----
; Same rationale and --match-verified declarator shapes as queries/c/tags.scm (the C++ grammar
; extends tree-sitter-c): file-scope `static const char* DEFAULT_HOSTS[] = { … }` tables and
; namespace-scope `inline constexpr int MAX_DEPTH = 12;`. Two scope wrappers because namespace
; (and extern "C") bodies are declaration_list, not translation_unit; class members are
; field_declaration_list, so member fields never match either pattern (they get their own capture
; below, 2026-08-12). Gated in ingest.cpp (dropConstantCapture): SCREAMING_SNAKE keeps (the r3 q10
; convention), and since the 2026-08-12 module-constant round a const/constexpr/constinit
; type_qualifier on the declaration ALSO keeps, case-blind — the qualifier keyword is the evidence
; (the Rust const_item rationale), which is what makes `constexpr std::uint32_t kParserVer = 61;`
; findable by name. Mutable non-SCREAMING globals still drop.

; ---- class-static constants (ripwire addition — the module-constant round, 2026-08-12) ----
; `static constexpr int kMaxDepth = 3;` inside a class/struct/union body is a field_declaration
; (NOT a declaration/init_declarator — in-class member initializers bind through the default_value
; field), so the module-scope patterns above never see it: pre-fix NO class-static constant was
; indexed, not even a SCREAMING one (probed 2026-08-12). This pattern is deliberately LOOSE — it
; also matches every plain default-member-initializer (`int retries = 3;`) — because tags-pass
; predicates never run (see the cast-keyword note below) and child ORDER between `static` and
; `constexpr` is not fixed in source. The whole keep decision lives in ingest.cpp
; (fieldConstantCaptureKept): keep iff the field carries BOTH a `static` storage_class_specifier
; AND a const/constexpr/constinit type_qualifier — per-instance fields (default-initialized or
; const non-static) drop. Bitfields bind through bitfield_clause, never default_value, and cannot
; match. Class-scope variable templates sit under template_declaration, not directly in the
; field_declaration_list, and are out of scope (disclosed, not captured).

; `int& ref;`, `int buf[8];`, a bitfield `unsigned x : 3;` — declared or default-initialized alike.
; Deliberately LOOSE like the class-static-constant pattern above (tags-pass predicates never run):
; it also matches `static int live;` and `static constexpr int kMax = 3;`. The keep decision is
; ingest_names.h fieldCaptureKept: a `static` storage_class_specifier DROPS the capture — a class-static
; constant keeps its @definition.constant row above (t="var"), and a mutable static member is not a
; per-object field (disclosed in the --uses member legend). Method declarations bind through
; function_declarator and never match this alternation. Fields of an ANONYMOUS struct/union have no
; owner name and are dropped at extraction (Symbol::scope empty — disclosed). t="field",
; id=path::Owner::field; use-sites via --uses=Owner.field (test/fieldusescheck.sh).

; ---- CUDA memory-space module bindings (ripwire addition — the cudacheck §7b close-out) ----
; `__constant__ float rk_scaleTable[ 64 ];` carries NO initializer (host fills it via
; cudaMemcpyToSymbol), so the init_declarator patterns above can never match it — that, not the
; qualifier, was the measured 2026-08-04 gap. These two patterns take the UNINITIALIZED shape: a
; module-scope declaration with a plain (non-init, non-function) declarator. They carry NO qualifier
; constraint at all, for two stacked reasons measured on the vendored grammars: (1) the query cannot
; name the `__constant__` token — this file also compiles against tree-sitter-cpp (.cpp/.h/.metal),
; which lacks it, and ts_query_new would reject the whole query there; (2) a `(type_qualifier)` child
; constraint sees only `__constant__`/`__managed__` — tree-sitter-cuda parses `__device__` as an
; ANONYMOUS token child of the declaration (its only named children are the type and the declarator),
; invisible to any named-node constraint. The whole qualifier test therefore lives in ingest.cpp
; (cudaMemorySpaceQualifierOf), the same capture-time home as isCppCastKeyword, because tags-pass
; predicates never run (see the cast-keyword note below). Policy enforced there: `__constant__`
; extracts case-blind (the keyword is the evidence — the Rust const_item rationale);
; `__device__`/`__managed__` are mutable device globals and stay behind the SCREAMING gate; no
; memory-space token drops. The BLAST RADIUS of these unconstrained patterns is all of Lang::Cpp
; (.cpp/.cc/.cxx/.h/.hpp/.hh/.metal, not just .cu/.cuh), so it was measured, not argued (2026-08-10,
; port round): on ripwire's own src/ and on four real C++/CUDA trees the maps are BYTE-IDENTICAL to
; the pre-port binary's everywhere the qualifier is absent — every raw non-CUDA match is dropped by
; the ingest test, and the only added rows anywhere carry a memory-space qualifier in a .cu/.cuh.
; Function prototypes never match (their declarator is a function_declarator); function-local
; `__shared__` tiles never match (their scope is a compound_statement, not
; translation_unit/declaration_list).

; The same uninitialized shape under a PREPROCESSOR CONDITIONAL — measured against NVIDIA/cuda-samples
; (2026-08-04): the header-guard idiom (`#ifndef X_CUH` around the whole file) and the dual-compile
; `#ifdef __CUDACC__` region both make the declaration a child of preproc_ifdef/preproc_if (else/elif
; branches are their own node kinds), so the translation_unit/declaration_list anchors above never see
; it — volumeRender's `__constant__ float3x4 c_invViewMatrix;` and particles' `__constant__ SimParams
; cudaParams;` were measured misses. These four wrappers are deliberately UNANCHORED (guards nest:
; `#ifndef` guard + `#if` region is two levels), so they also fire on function-local declarations under
; a conditional — safe because legal CUDA allows the three memory-space qualifiers ONLY at namespace
; scope, so every function-local match lacks the qualifier and drops in ingest. 2-D tables
; (quasirandomGenerator's `c_Table[A][B]`) get the nested array_declarator alternative. The INITIALIZED
; patterns above deliberately do NOT gain preproc wrappers: that would newly extract #if-gated

; `#define MAXN 42` (preproc_def) — a value alias, not a call-edge participant (the C tags.scm keeps its

; QUALIFIED CALLS AT ANY DEPTH. tree-sitter-cpp nests

; qualified_identifier(scope: ctx, name: qualified_identifier(scope: inner, name: targetFn)) — so the
; 2-segment pattern this REPLACES (`name: (identifier)`) bound nothing past the second `::`: 31 in-repo
; call sites on the CLI↔MCP seams produced NO reference at all, invisible to --uses/--callers/--edit-check
; AND to `ambiguous=`/`unresolved=` (the drop is at EXTRACTION, before resolution can account for it).
; `name: (_)` is depth-unbounded and also covers the `name: (template_function)` case (`ns::tmplFn<int>()`),
; which needs no pattern of its own.
;
; WHY THE 2-SEGMENT PATTERN IS REPLACED, NOT KEPT ALONGSIDE. ingest.cpp mints ONE RawRef per query match and

; `unresolved=`. One pattern, one match, one reference.
;
; The captured @name is now the inner node, whose TEXT still carries the remaining scope
; (`inner::targetFn`); ingest.cpp re-splits it at the last TOP-LEVEL `::` into name + immediate qualifier so
; the canonical `qualifier::name` tier keeps resolving these precisely at every depth. finalSegment() alone
; is NOT safe here — it truncates at the first `<`, which would name

;
; WHY THE CAST KEYWORDS ARE NOT EXCLUDED HERE. tree-sitter-cpp parses `static_cast<T>(x)` as this exact
